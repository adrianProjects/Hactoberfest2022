# Encoding - Decoding NLP

Encoding and Decoding comes under sequence to sequence modeling which is nothing but aims to map a fixed-length input with a fixed-length output where the length of input and output may differ.

Procedure to perform Encoding-Decoding on String.

Step 1 - Take a sample string
Sample_string = 'Hi this is Adrian'

Step 2 - Print the Sample string
print('The Sample string is:', Sample_string)

The Sample string is: HI this is Adrian
Step 3 - Encode the Sample string

Sample_encode = Sample_string.encode()
By default the string gets encoded in "utf-8"

Step 4 - Decode the encoded string
Sample_decode = Sample_encode.decode()

Step 5 - Print the results

print('The encoded string is:', Sample_encode, '\n')
print('The decoded string is:', Sample_decode)

The encoded string is: b'Hi this is Adrian'
